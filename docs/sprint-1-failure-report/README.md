# Sprint 1 Failure Report - Eliza Remote Deployment

## Executive Summary

Sprint 1 aimed to containerize the Eliza multi-agent system and deploy it to DigitalOcean's container registry. The sprint was unsuccessful due to multiple technical challenges, primarily related to build compatibility issues, native module dependencies, and architectural constraints.

## Goals and Objectives

1. Containerize the Eliza multi-agent system
2. Push the container image to registry.digitalocean.com/pioneer/pioneer-agent
3. Establish a CI/CD pipeline through CircleCI
4. Deploy to the DigitalOcean Kubernetes cluster via Pulumi

## Timeline

- Sprint Start: March 20, 2024
- Sprint End: March 20, 2024 (early termination due to critical failures)

## What Failed

### 1. Docker Build Failures

The Docker build process failed due to several issues:

- **JSON Syntax Error**: Initial build failed due to a syntax error in package.json (trailing comma).
- **Native Module Compilation**: After fixing the JSON error, the build encountered issues with native modules and platform-specific dependencies:
  - @rollup/rollup-linux-arm64-gnu
  - @anush008/tokenizers-linux-arm64-gnu
  - fastembed

### 2. Architecture-specific Issues

- The build process struggled with ARM64 vs AMD64 architecture discrepancies.
- Multiple native modules lacked ARM64 support, leading to build failures.

### 3. Dependency Resolution Problems

- Even with attempts to modify the build process to skip optional dependencies (`--no-optional`), the build encountered issues with:
  - `@swc/core` missing native bindings
  - `esbuild` missing platform-specific packages

### 4. Simplified Build Workaround

- A simplified "demo" container was created for documentation purposes
- While this container built successfully, it was not functional for actual deployment

## Attempted Solutions

1. **Fix JSON Syntax**: Removed the trailing comma from package.json
2. **Platform-specific Build**: Modified the Dockerfile to include platform detection and conditional build processes
3. **Dependency Overrides**: Tried to use `--no-optional` flag and dependency overrides for problematic packages
4. **Simplified Docker Build**: Created a minimal container with just an Express server and static content for demo purposes

## Root Causes

1. **Complex Dependency Tree**: Eliza has numerous dependencies, many with native components requiring specific build environments.
2. **Architecture Mismatch**: Development on ARM64 (M-series Mac) but deployment targeting AMD64 Linux servers.
3. **Native Module Issues**: Critical dependencies rely on platform-specific native code that's difficult to cross-compile.

## Lessons Learned

1. **Containerization Challenges**: Applications with complex dependencies require careful planning for containerization.
2. **Architecture Considerations**: Development and target deployment architectures should be aligned or emulated properly.
3. **Dependency Management**: A more careful audit of dependencies and their platform requirements is needed before containerization.

## Recommendations

1. **Reconstruct Dockerfile**: Create a new Dockerfile with multi-stage builds that properly handles architecture-specific issues.
2. **Reduce Native Dependencies**: Review and potentially replace dependencies that cause cross-platform issues.
3. **Emulate Target Architecture**: Use Docker's BuildKit capabilities to properly build for the target architecture.
4. **CI Environment Testing**: Test the build process in the CI environment before committing to the full pipeline.

## Next Steps

1. Revert changes made during this sprint
2. Re-evaluate the containerization strategy
3. Consider using a different base image or build process
4. Create a more targeted approach for handling native dependencies

## Technical Artifacts

- Modified Dockerfiles (original, simple, and prebuilt versions)
- CircleCI configuration changes
- Server.js workaround for demonstration purposes

### JSON Syntax Error
```
ERROR  Expected double-quoted property name in JSON at position 1505 (line 27 column 3) while parsing '{  "name": "eliza",  "scripts": {    ' in /app/package.json
