# Sprint 1 Failure Documentation Index

## Overview

Sprint 1 focused on containerizing the Eliza multi-agent system and deploying it to DigitalOcean's container registry. This sprint was unsuccessful due to multiple technical challenges, primarily related to containerization and architecture compatibility issues.

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Architecture Mismatch**: Development on ARM64 (M-series Mac) but deployment targeting AMD64 Linux servers caused significant native module compatibility issues.

2. **Dependency Complexity**: Eliza's complex dependency tree with numerous native modules presented major cross-compilation challenges.

3. **Platform-Specific Issues**: Multiple key dependencies lacked ARM64 support or required special handling for cross-platform builds.

4. **Container Build Process**: The sequential nature of CircleCI jobs meant registry push testing could only be verified after successful container builds, which never completed.

## Next Steps

1. Revert all Sprint 1 changes
2. Implement revised approach per the next sprint recommendations
3. Focus on solving containerization challenges before attempting registry push
4. Test containerization in CircleCI-like environment locally

## Required Resources for Sprint 2

1. CircleCI environment with AMD64 architecture
2. DigitalOcean API token with appropriate permissions
3. Access to Pulumi deployment repository
4. Development time focused on containerization solutions
