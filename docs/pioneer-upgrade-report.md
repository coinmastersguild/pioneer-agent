# Pioneer Agent Deployment Upgrade Report

## Actions Completed

1. **Infrastructure Upgrade**
   - Updated Pulumi configuration to use s-4vcpu-8gb nodes (from s-2vcpu-2gb)
   - Created new node pool "larger-nodes" with 3 s-4vcpu-8gb instances
   - Verified successful deployment of new nodes with no Cilium network taints

2. **Deployment Configuration Fixes**
   - Fixed health check configuration by changing port from named "proxy" to numeric 8080
   - Added nodeSelector to schedule pods on the new larger nodes
   - Successfully migrated pod to the new node infrastructure

## Current Errors

**Container Image Issue**
- Container fails with: `Error: Cannot find module 'express'`
- Pod status: CrashLoopBackOff
- Error occurs in both old and new nodes, confirming it's a container image issue
- Root cause: Docker image was built without properly installing dependencies

## Next Steps Required

1. **Rebuild Container Image**
   - Rebuild the pioneer-agent Docker image with proper dependency installation
   - Ensure `npm install` is run correctly during the build process
   - Update the image tag in the container registry

2. **Update Health Check Configuration**
   - Maintain the fixed health check configuration (port 8080 instead of "proxy")
   - Validate configuration matches actual container endpoints

3. **Complete Migration to Larger Nodes**
   - Once container image is fixed, verify all pods are running on new nodes
   - Consider deleting the old node pool once all workloads are stable

4. **Implement Monitoring**
   - Add resource usage monitoring to detect potential issues earlier
   - Configure alerts for container crash loops and resource constraints
