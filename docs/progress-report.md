# Pioneer Agent Deployment Troubleshooting Progress Report

## Identified Issues

1. **Resource Constraints**
   - Pioneer-agent pod is stuck in `Pending` state
   - Scheduler reports: `0/5 nodes are available: 5 Insufficient memory`
   - Pod requests (2Gi memory, 1 CPU) and limits (4Gi memory, 2 CPU) exceed available node resources
   - `NotTriggerScaleUp` events indicate cluster autoscaling isn't configured to create larger nodes

2. **API Health Endpoint Inaccessible**
   - `curl -k https://134.199.184.173/api/health` returns 404
   - `http://134.199.184.173/api/health` redirects to HTTPS but then fails
   - LoadBalancer IP (143.198.246.24) assigned but not responding
   - Health check path may be misconfigured in deployment (`/api/health` vs `/health`)

3. **Ingress Configuration Issues**
   - No IngressRoute resources found in any namespace
   - Multiple Traefik configurations exist (traefik, traefik-patched)
   - No ingress rules defined to route traffic to the pioneer-agent service

4. **Container Issues**
   - Previous deployment attempts failed with `ImagePullBackOff` errors
   - No container logs available as pod hasn't started

5. **SSL Certificate Problems**
   - Server using default self-signed Traefik certificate
   - Certificate verification fails for API calls

## Current Infrastructure State

- LoadBalancer IPs:
  - Traefik: 134.199.184.173 (functioning)
  - Pioneer-agent: 143.198.246.24 (not functioning)
- Kubernetes Services:
  - `traefik`: LoadBalancer exposing ports 80, 443
  - `pioneer-agent`: LoadBalancer exposing port 80 → 8080
  - `svc-pioneer-agent-0ojfocv9`: ClusterIP exposing ports 3000, 5173, 8080
- Key Deployments:
  - `pioneer-agent`: 0/1 ready (pod pending)
  - `traefik`: 1/1 ready

## Next Steps

1. **Address Resource Constraints**
   - Reduce memory/CPU requests for pioneer-agent deployment
   - Or provision larger nodes in the Kubernetes cluster

2. **Fix Ingress Configuration**
   - Create IngressRoute to direct traffic to the pioneer-agent service
   - Configure proper routing for `/api/health` endpoint

3. **Image Pull Verification**
   - Ensure `registry.digitalocean.com/pioneer/pioneer-agent:latest` is accessible
   - Check registry credentials if needed

4. **Service Configuration**
   - Verify service port mappings (80 → 8080)
   - Confirm health check paths are consistent across deployment and service

5. **CORS Configuration**
   - Once service is running, verify and fix CORS headers for client access
