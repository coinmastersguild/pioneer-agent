# Sprint 2: Eliza Multi-Agent Containerization

This directory contains all files and scripts for Sprint 2, which focuses on successfully containerizing the Eliza multi-agent system and deploying it to DigitalOcean's container registry.

## Overview

Sprint 2 addresses the challenges identified in Sprint 1 with a revised approach to containerization, improved dependency management, and a more robust CI/CD pipeline.

## Directory Structure

- `Dockerfile.improved` - The improved Dockerfile for building Eliza
- `build-env/` - Tools for setting up a CircleCI-like local development environment
- `circleci-config.yml` - Updated CircleCI configuration for build and deploy
- `dependency-audit.sh` - Script to identify problematic native modules
- `build-test.sh` - Script to build and test the Docker image locally

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup Local CircleCI-like Environment

```bash
cd sprint-2/build-env
./setup.sh
```

This script builds a container that mimics the CircleCI environment for local testing.

### 2. Run Dependency Audit

```bash
cd sprint-2
./dependency-audit.sh
```

This script identifies native modules and architecture-specific dependencies that may cause issues.

### 3. Build and Test Docker Image

```bash
cd sprint-2
./build-test.sh
```

This script builds the Docker image and runs a test container.

### 4. CircleCI Integration

The updated CircleCI configuration in `circleci-config.yml` includes:

1. A build verification step that tests the build without pushing
2. The actual build and push step that sends the image to DigitalOcean
3. A Pulumi deployment step that deploys to Kubernetes

## Improvements from Sprint 1

1. **Node 18 Instead of 23**: Using Node 18 for better compatibility with native modules
2. **Dependency Overrides**: Added explicit overrides for problematic modules
3. **Multi-Stage Build**: Improved multi-stage build process with better separation
4. **Platform Targeting**: Explicit platform targeting for AMD64
5. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better error reporting and recovery

## CircleCI Workflow

The workflow has three main jobs:

1. `build-verification`: Validates the Dockerfile and tests building without pushing
2. `build-and-push-eliza`: Builds and pushes the image to DigitalOcean
3. `deploy-eliza-pulumi`: Deploys the image using Pulumi

## Next Steps

After successful testing in the local CircleCI-like environment:

1. Create a `sprint-2` branch
2. Push the changes to trigger the CircleCI pipeline
3. Monitor the build and deployment process
4. Verify the deployment in DigitalOcean Kubernetes
